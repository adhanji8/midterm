## Third Section

1. Git folder is the directory created when git init is called in the command line. or if you do git clone. It is the git repository.
2.  git hash-object:
    when you put something in like a string. it will give you back a hash key. that hash key can go retrieve stuff in the object folder.

3. git compresses files and stores it into its own data structure under the object directory(folder). There are 4 types of object git uses: "blob", "tree", "commit" and "tag".
The "blob" is used to store file data. 
tree is the representation of all the blobs in directory. It references other trees or blob like sub-directories.
